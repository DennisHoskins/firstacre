# Interview Challenge

Your task will be to refactor a React component as you see fit, keeping in mind things like maintainability, readability, code organization, etc.

# Setup

This project will start a mock REST API server on startup. You can view the data in `/api/db.json`.
We also need to run the frontend dev server, so open a new terminal window below and enter `npm run dev`.
Finally, open the `/src/components/Books.tsx` file and take a moment to review it.

When you're ready, describe and carry out your plan to refactor the component.
